    Assume I am at the coordinate (0,0) facing forward along the x-axis.
    Based on the given image of a race track, choose the best trajectory to drive the car.
    The road is the dark gray area. Stay on the road. The wall has a blue and white pattern.
    
    Command options (output one of these for the next action):
    - turn right
    - turn left
    - go straight

    History:
    - Last Trajectory: {last_trajectory_action}
    - Last sector: {last_sector}
    - Current Velocity: {current_velocity:.2f} m/s
    - Current Position: distance from initial position: {calculate_distance(current_position, initial_position):.2f} m
    {track_knowledge}
    Your task: Determine the current sector and generate a trajectory and command.
    What is my future trajectory in next 5 seconds under vehicle coordinate?

      "command": "turn right|turn left|go straight",
      "trajectory_points": [
        {{"x": float, "y": float, "z": float, "time": float, "velocity": float}},

    - x, y, z coordinates (vehicle coordinate system, x: forward, y: left, z: up)
    - time: time from now (0.0 to 5.0 seconds)
    - velocity: target velocity in m/s

    Ensure smooth trajectory that follows the road and maintains safe driving.
    Don't forget that the sector 2 is a right hairpin. Before that, you should slow down.
